<h2>Pat Marcanio</h2>
<h4>VP of Sales &amp; Marketing</h4>
<p>Pat joined Fresh to apply skills he acquired in large organizations to a smaller company where productivity and results are measured and noticed.&nbsp; As former sales manager in both distribution and manufacturing, Pat was able to quickly crystallize the needs of customers and position products and programs to support users, and the channel.&nbsp; His chemistry and business degrees are a unique combination and have proven useful in analysis and business case development for Fresh</p>
<h4>Why Fresh</h4>
<p>Fresh Products introduces new innovation every year.&nbsp; We obsolete our own products, and introduce new ones to serve users and the channel in a way they never thought was possible.&nbsp; We make your world smell great, while most are just trying to make it smell less bad.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Fresh ownership and board is never satisfied with how things are, and constantly look to upgrade our products and programs.&nbsp; I love having new projects to work, products to sell and programs to market.&nbsp; What could be better!</p>

<h4>Why Fresh</h4>
<p>Because I love the fact that what I do here makes a difference every day, whether that be on the technical side, new product development side on the manufacturing side of the operation.&nbsp; The team at Fresh challenges one another to be better, and that culture runs through the company and makes Fresh an exciting place to work.&nbsp; We strive to be the best and manufacture the best products.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re not interested in making &ldquo;me-too&rdquo; products and copying a competitive idea.&nbsp; We want to make products that are a whole bunch better than the competition and that means that there&rsquo;s always exciting challenges ahead, especially when it means raising the performance standard and making our own products obsolete.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a great place to work!</p>
