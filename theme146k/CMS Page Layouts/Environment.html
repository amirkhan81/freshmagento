<p>You&rsquo;re more than just a rest stop. You&rsquo;re a familiar face. An eagerly anticipated mile marker on a long drive home.</p>

<h4>Testimonials</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Told our distributor to &ldquo;Never substitute the imitation Wave for the real wave product. They flat out do NOT work.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em><br /> Mike &ndash; Convenience Store- Division Manager - KS</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I would like to take the time to let you know that the Easy Fresh product we purchase has been so wonderful for use in all seven of our facilities throughout the Pittsburgh area. Many of our buildings have restrooms that are unvented, and before this product, odor was always a problem. Thanks again for developing such a great air freshener &ndash; it&rsquo;s been a lifesaver for us!&rdquo;&nbsp; </em><br /> Jennifer, Store Manager - PA</p>
